# Design Contest: Create Our New Twitter Image Assets!

We're looking for talented designers in our community to help us create a new set of shareable images for our social media channels.

This is your chance to put your creative stamp on the Lightning Bounties brand and earn some sats for your work.

## The Mission

We need three distinct image templates for our Twitter posts. Each design should be clean, eye-catching, and clearly communicate its purpose while feeling like a part of the Lightning Bounties family.

### Design Categories
1.  **Bounty Hunter of the Month:** An asset to celebrate and showcase our top contributor each month. This should feel prestigious and exciting.
2.  **New Bounty Alert:** A template to announce a brand new, high-profile bounty. This should generate urgency and interest.
3.  **Open Bounty Alert:** A general template for highlighting existing open bounties that need a hunter. This is about visibility and opportunity.
